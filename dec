The master branch, also known as the development branch, contains the latest bleeding edge code. There are also several stable branches where stable releases come from. These take the form OpenSSL_x_y_z-stable so, for example, the 1.0.0 stable branch is OpenSSL_1_0_0-stable. When an actual release is made it is tagged in the form OpenSSL_x_y_zp or a beta OpenSSL_x_y_xp-betan, though you should normally just download the release tarball. Tags and branches are occasionally used for other purposes such as testing experimental or unstable code before it is merged into another branch.
